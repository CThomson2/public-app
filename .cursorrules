## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. **Request Analysis**

   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)

   - Identify languages and frameworks involved

   - Note explicit and implicit requirements

   - Define core problem and desired outcome

   - Consider project context and constraints

2. **Solution Planning**

   - Break down the solution into logical steps

   - Consider modularity and reusability

   - Identify necessary files and dependencies

   - Evaluate alternative approaches

   - Plan for testing and validation

3. **Implementation Strategy**

   - Choose appropriate design patterns

   - Consider performance implications

   - Plan for error handling and edge cases

   - Ensure accessibility compliance

   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code

- Use functional and declarative programming patterns

- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

- Implement early returns for better readability

- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)

- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)

- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

Use TypeScript for all code

- Prefer interfaces over types

- Avoid enums; use const maps instead

- Implement proper type safety and inference

- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible

- Minimize `'use client'` directives

- Implement proper error boundaries

- Use Suspense for async operations

- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`

- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)

- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'

- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const headersList = await headers();
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode();

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params;
const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
```

### Data Fetching

- Fetch requests are no longer cached by default

- Use `cache: 'force-cache'` for specific cached requests

- Implement `fetchCache = 'default-cache'` for layout/page-level caching

- Use appropriate fetching methods (Server Components, SWR, React Query)

### Route Handlers

```typescript
// Cached route handler example
export const dynamic = "force-static";

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const params = await request.params;
  // Implementation
}
```

## Prisma Integration

### Core Concepts

- Use Prisma as the ORM for database interactions, ensuring type safety and ease of use.

- Leverage Prisma Client for querying the database.

- Define data models using Prisma Schema Language.

- Utilize migrations for schema changes and version control.

### Setup and Configuration

```bash
# Install Prisma CLI
npm install prisma --save-dev

# Initialize Prisma in the project
npx prisma init
```

- Configure the `schema.prisma` file with the appropriate datasource and generator.

```prisma
// schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in the environment variables.

### Data Modeling

- Define data models following normalization principles and application requirements.

// Example data model implementation

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  posts     Post[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

- Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for models and fields.

### Database Migrations

- Use Prisma Migrate to handle schema changes.

```bash
# Create a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive-migration-name

# Apply migrations to the database
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

- Commit migration files to version control for collaboration and history tracking.

### Querying the Database

- Use Prisma Client for type-safe database queries.

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// Example: Fetch all published posts
const publishedPosts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: { published: true },
  include: { author: true },
});
```

- Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting as per application needs.

### Error Handling

- Handle potential database errors gracefully using try-catch blocks.

```typescript
try {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: "user@example.com",
      name: "John Doe",
    },
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle unique constraint violation
  if (error.code === "P2002") {
    // Duplicate email
  } else {
    // Other errors
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Connection Management**: Ensure Prisma Client is reused to prevent excessive connections.

  ```typescript
  // lib/prisma.ts
  import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

  const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient };

  export const prisma =
    globalForPrisma.prisma ||
    new PrismaClient({
      log: ["query", "info", "warn", "error"],
    });

  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
  ```

- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage database credentials and connection strings using environment variables.

- **Type Safety**: Utilize Prisma's type-safe queries to prevent runtime errors.

- **Performance Optimization**: Use `select` and `include` to fetch only necessary fields.

- **Code Organization**: Abstract database operations into separate service layers or repositories for maintainability.

### Example Route Handler with Prisma

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

export default async function handler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  if (req.method === "GET") {
    const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
    res.status(200).json(users);
  } else if (req.method === "POST") {
    const { email, name } = req.body;
    try {
      const user = await prisma.user.create({
        data: { email, name },
      });
      res.status(201).json(user);
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(400).json({ error: "User creation failed." });
    }
  } else {
    res.setHeader("Allow", ["GET", "POST"]);
    res.status(405).end(`Method ${req.method} Not Allowed`);
  }
}
```

## UI Development

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS with a desktop-first approach

- Implement Chakra UI components

- Follow consistent spacing and layout patterns

- Ensure responsive design across breakpoints

### Accessibility

- Implement proper ARIA attributes

- Ensure keyboard navigation

- Provide appropriate alt text

- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines

- Test with screen readers

### Performance

- Optimize images (WebP, sizing, lazy loading)

- Implement code splitting

- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Configuration

### TypeScript Config

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "noEmit": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Code Quality

- Implement comprehensive error handling

- Write maintainable, self-documenting code

- Follow security best practices

- Ensure proper type coverage

- Use ESLint and Prettier

Remember: Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest React 19, Chakra UI, and Prisma features and best practices.

## General Guidance below

- Do not delete descriptive comments when editing code or suggesting changes, unless the code the comments are referring to is being deleted.
- You are proactive and you should suggest changes to the codebase whenever you notice the following:
  - Unneccessary code duplication or inefficiencies
  - Similar code split across multiple files (e.g. many component files used to build one main component, which could be created entirely in one or two files)
  - Unused or redundant files or modules
  - Disorganised file structure: meaning overly-convoluted folders and subfolders, or files within folders they shouldn't be in (conventionally or logically)
  - Inconsistent, misleading or unconventional naming of variables, files and folders

Response Constraints

- Explain any replacement code with a comment when deleting any existing code.
- Be consistent with the formatting of my imports.
- Be consistent with the formatting of my code unless important for new functionality.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
